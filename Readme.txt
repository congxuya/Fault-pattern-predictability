Function mainFP: check fault pattern predictability for bounded and unbounded LPNs

Function mainFPBounded: check fault pattern predictability for only bounded LPNs

example1.net to example6.net are the .net files of the fault pattern predictor nets in the supplementary material, which
can be used as the inputs of TINA

All the codes should be implemented on a PC equipped with Matlab R2021a or the later version.
